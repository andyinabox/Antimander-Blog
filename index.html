Properties like compactness and fairness are desired but subjective tradeoffs between them often exist. As a result, it is difficult to deffinitively show that a districting could be more fair. Evaluating a districting by comparing it to a set of possiblities has become a theoretically attractive approach. However, generating a large set of satisfactory districts is a significant technical challence because states may be composed of tens of thousands of geographic units, with trade-offs between many competing objectives.</p><p>Algorithms cannot create 'ideal' districts becuase they do not exist. How one balances compactness vs fairness is subjective. Like with generative design tools, the goal is to present an optimal set of options for every trade-off that can be used for comparison.</p><p>Antimander proposes connecting algorithmic districting to the research field of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) and novelty search and presents an open source optimization engine and viewer that does so.

The distribution of elected representatives has significant political impact, motivating political parties to exploit such districting to their advantage, known as gerrymandering. For example, districtings can pack a small number of districts full of the opposing party’s voters to waste many votes, enabling other districts to crack i.e. to be won by a small (but comfortable) amount, thereby securing an outsize proportion of a state’s representatives for the gerrymandering party.</p><p>The Supreme Court has ruled that while gerrymandering may be unjust, an impartial means to evaluate it is lacking. While many properties of districts (e.g. compactness and fairness) are desired, subjective tradeoffs between them often exist. As a result, it is difficult to deffinitively show that a districting could be more fair.Evaluating a districting by comparing it to a set of possiblities has become a theoretically attractive approach. However, generating a large set of satisfactory districts is a significant technical challence because states may be composed of tens of thousands of geographic units, with trade-offs between many competing objectives. Previous approaches apply Monte Carlo methods [1], single-objective evolutionary algorithms [4], and non-evolutionary two-objective methods [6] to generate districtings. Antimander is a open source, multi-objective evolutionary that creates optimzied dsitricts for comparison.</p></div></div><div class="viewer_row" id="viewer"><div class="district-viewer"><h2 class="header">Interactive Viewer</h2><div class="parcoords"></div><div class="padding" style="height:20px;"></div><canvas class="main_canvas" width="1024" height="1024"></canvas></div><div class="district-text"><div class="district-text-inner"><div class="block"><p>On the left we see a grid of random samples.
