                h2.section_header Overview:
                p Once a decade the United States takes a census of its population and accordingly redraws congressional districts to ensure that each state is fairly divided into equal populations. How they are drawn determines the distribution of elected representatives and has significant political impact, motivating political parties to exploit districting to their advantage, known as gerrymandering. Gerrymandering has become a challenge to democracy in large part because because it is challenging to define.

                p Gerrymandering works by "packing" a small number of districts full of the opposing party’s voters to "waste" many votes, enabling other districts to "crack," i.e. to be won by a small (but comfortable) amount, thereby securing an outsize proportion of a state’s representatives for the gerrymandering party.

                p While a districting should intuitively be 'fair' to each party, often multiple objectives are desired, such as being 'regularly shaped' and having competitive elections.  Many metrics have been defined (#[a(href='#metrics') discussed below]) but their relative importance are ultimately subjective and the baselines for 'good' vary by state. As a result, there is no one 'ideal district' and it is difficult to definitively show that a districting could be more fair. This has led to the Supreme Court ruling that while gerrymandering may be unjust, an impartial means to evaluate it is lacking. - #[a(href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vieth_v._Jubelirer') Vieth v. Jubelirer] (2004). In #[a(href='https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/18-422_9ol1.pdf',target='_blank') Rucho v. Common Cause (2019)] the court returned to gerrymandering ruling that partisan gerrymandering is not justiciable in federal court and litigation must shift to state courts.

                p Thankfully, the admissibility of algorithmic evidence provides some hope. Evaluating a districting by comparing it to a set of reasonable alternatives has recently become a theoretically attractive approach since it takes into account natural biases of geography and voter distribution and provides clear counter examples. However, generating a large set of satisfactory districts is a significant technical challenge because states may be composed of tens of thousands of geographic units, with trade-offs between many competing objectives. In Common Cause v. Lewis, comparing a proposed plan to randomly sampled and algorithmically generated examples helped convince the court that the proposed plan was a biased outlier. More discussion of current methods is (#[a(href='#methods') discussed below])

                //- p The districting problem is the partitioning of an undirected connected graph into a fixed number of districts. Each node in the graph represents the geographic unit of a state that composes a district, and contains a number of voters registered for each political party.The partitioning of the state has two constraints: the total population of each district must be approximately equal (i.e. it cannot deviate more than specific percentage from the state’s total population divided by the number of districts), and each district must be contiguous.
                p There remains a need for both an open-source library that can optimize such a complex problem with many objectives in addition to an interface for making the results accessible. Having this would bring transparency the tradeoffs and how they were made for existing districts as well as be courtroom evidence to prove partisan gerrymandering. This work connects the problem of congressional districting to the fields of generative design, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) and novelty search.

            //- p Like with generative design tools, the goal is to present an optimal set of options for every trade-off that can be used for comparison.

            //- p Despite gerrymandering remaining a challenge, there is promise that algorithmic developments may o er relief. Towards that end, we have demonstrated a method and open-source tool that optimizes districts across several objectives using multi-objective evolution. Our study in Wisconsin demonstrates the capacity to produce districts that are more equal, competitive, and compact than the current real-world districts.

            //- p However, for tools like this to be successful they must incorporate many further measures, including majority-minority districts, preserving areas of interest, and other metrics that vary in importance by state. We suggest the districting problem as a potential MOEA benchmark for both technical reasons and because of its timely need for the 2021 redistricting.



            //- p Here we present an evolutionary multi-objective approach to identify gerrymandering, building on recent approaches that contrast a prospective districting with an ensemble of simulated solutions [7]. The premise is that a fair districting should not be heavily Pareto-dominated by such simulated solutions. However, generating a large set of satisfactory districts is a signi cant technical because states may be composed of tens of thousands of geographic units, with trade-o s between many competing objectives. Previous approaches apply Monte Carlo methods [1], single- objective evolutionary algorithms [4], and non-evolutionary two- objective methods [6] to generate districtings. However, there re- mains a need for an optimization tool that can scale to thousands of geographic units, several constraints, and more than two objectives. This paper connects the problem of congressional districting to the research  eld of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) and novelty search. We introduce and validate a framework and open source library called Antimander1 for multi-objective optimiization of congressional districts.

                p The original gerrymander was named for its peculiar shape and it is intuitively desirable to expect to live near people within the same district. A lot of attention is therefore paid to the shape of districts, especially since - unlike other metrics - it is easy to evaluate visually. But what does it mean for a shape to be 'compact'? It turns out there are many metrics that can be used. Images below are from #[a(href="https://fisherzachary.github.io/public/r-output.html") this article] which also has additional metrics.

Some domains handle this by creating a weighted average 'composite' goal. This requires picking a precise and often arbitrary weighting A priori. Consider picking an airplane flight, usually some balance of speed and affordability is desired but that tradeoff is subjective and it's hard to weight them without seeing the options. Multi objective optimization is the process of finding the optimal set of solutions.

                p The districting problem is the partitioning of an undirected connected graph into a fixed number of districts. Each node in the graph represents the geographic unit of a state that composes a district, and contains a number of voters registered for each political party. The partitioning of the state has two constraints: the total population of each district must be approximately equal and each district must be contiguous.
                //- p Here we optimize districtings for three objectives Polspy-Popper (compactness), Equality-Gap (fairness) and competitiveness. As discussed above, many other measures beyond those exist, and Antimander tool can be used with measures most appropriate for a particular state.

To improve upon NSGA-II (which when applied naively failed to generate any feasible solutions), we explore a series of extensions: multi-phase optimization, novelty search (NS), and feasible-infeasible (FIF) search. Crossover is not employed due to the challenges of combining diverse partitions to generate viable and meaningful new solutions.

                h3 Representation & Seeding
                p Districts are represented as integer arrays, where each node is assigned to a district. Initial individuals are created by taking random seed nodes and iteratively adding adjacent random unassigned nodes until there are no unassigned nodes left. A hill-climbing repair operator mutates the random districts until they meet the equality threshold constraint.

                p The mutation operator simply takes a node bordering another district and swaps the district it belongs to. To make exploring the search space practical, the mutation operator only allows mutations that preserve the contiguity of the district. Calculating graph connectedness after every mutation would be computationally prohibitive and so a local adjacency graph is created for each node for fast checks.
                //-  Instead, local adjacency graph for every node is pre-computed. This graph on node N is the sub-graph where every node is a neighbor of N. To determine if a node N may be removed from a partition without breaking contiguity, a simple search is done on the graph to see if all members that belong to that district remain connected.

                    i Mutation process: A node (orange outline) is random selected to swap districts. The circles are the immediate adjacency graph, a simple DFS is done on nodes in the same district (black-circles). Here we see that removing the orange node would break the district and is therefore prohibited. A full graph traversal is not needed because of assumptions about the structure of districts (such that one district will never fully enclosed another district) that are preserved by the objectives.

                p Novelty search explicitly promotes phenotypic diversity, thereby assisting exploration [ #[a.cite(href='') cite] ]. Novelty Search requires a behavior description that captures important traits in few dimensions. Multiple characterization descriptors were tested. One of the challenges was a method that would be invariance to swapping district id's since those are functionally equivalent.

                p The double constraints of contiguity and equality propose a challenge for the optimization process since the mast majority of the possibilities are inviable. Often, finding a good solution requires explores some bad ones first. Some genetic-algorithms simply throw out invalid solutions while others keep them in the same population but with a penalty to their fitness. A more elegant solution is to keep two populations of solutions, one for feasible individuals (those that satisfy all constraints) and one for infeasible (FIF). The feasible optimize for all the objectives while the infeasible optimize to satisfy the objectives. Liapis et all (cite Enhancements to Constrained Novelty Search) propose combining novelty search with FIF.

                p Because optimizing a large number of nodes directly is challenging, districts are optimized through a multi-phase evolutionary algorithm, where each successive phase divides districts more granularly (similarly to Swarmy et al. cite{swamymulti}). To create a series of coarsening graphs, the graph is iteratively contracted using star contraction \cite[ch. 13]{ab-algorithms} until the state has reached 500 nodes (a resolution amenable to direct optimization). An additional bias is added to preserve compact shapes across graph resolutions. The results of optimizing at a more coarse representation serve as a starting point for optimizing the successive (less-coarse) phase.
                p TODO repalce with a state contracted
            //- The multi-objective evolutionary algorithm NSGA-II \cite{deb2002fast} is used to optimize the populations at each phase. The implementation used of NGSA-II [pymoo] handles constraints by placing infeasible solutions into their own front. A spatially aware mutation operator (described below) is implemented to encourage feasible mutations.

Census and geographic data was downloaded from the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group's mggg-states #[a(href='https://github.com/mggg-states/WI-shapefiles') Github repository]. Voters for each party were the average voters in the 2012 and 2016 presidential election. Wisconsin has eight congressional districts composed from 6634 census wards.

//- Exploring the results allows us ot build intuition about the relaitonships of tradeoffs and environment.
//- THe value of making complex decison decisionas accessible for everyone
//- The value of design research and application.

//- FIF is the liek saying "this doesnt work but has promise so lets see where it goes"
//- Optimziation is also useful for better understanding the limits of the metrics and how they may be abused.
    //- For example the need to have sqaure error scaling to repvent singel distircts from being super gerrymandered
    //- Or, for lost votes to only count when above a threshold

                p Three methods were compared: NSGA-II, feasible-infeasible search (FIF), and FIF with novelty as an additional objective in the infeasible population only (FIF-NOV). Each run had a total population of 800, and consisted of 1000 generations per each of its five phases. Each run was replicated five times.
                p FIF with novelty outperformed vanilla NSGA-2 and FIF without novelty. Somewhat suprisingly, FIF did worse than NSGA if no novelty was employed.

                p Comparing actual and optimized Wisconsin districts. Shown optimized solutions are hand-chosen from those that dominate the actual districting (i.e. strictly lower score on all measures) (a) Wisconsin's 2011 districts have scores: fairness=0.788, competitiveness=%53.16, equality=%8.46. (b) An optimized compact district from a FIF-NOV run: fairness=0.647, competitiveness=%17.98, equality=%0.76. The solution is quantatively and qualitatively more compact than the actual districting. (c) An optimized district with maximum fairness and competitiveness from a FIF-NOV run: fairness=0.762, competitiveness=%13.12, equality=%0.0 Remarkably this districting had exactly 726419 lost votes for each party.

                p Despite gerrdymandering remaining a challenge, there is promise that algorithmic developments may offer relief. Towards that end, we have demonstrated a method and open-source tool that optimizes districts across several objectives using multi-objective evolution. Our study in Wisconsin demonstrates the capacity to produce districts that are more equal, competitive, and compact than the current real-world districts. However, for tools like this to be successful they must incorporate many further measures, including majority-minority districts, preserving areas of interest, and other metrics that vary in importance by state. We suggest the districting problem as a potential MOEA benchmark for both technical reasons and because of its timely need for the 2021 redistricting.
